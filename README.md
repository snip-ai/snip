# snip 🦀✂️

### The token & context optimizer for Claude Code

**snip is a tiny, blazing-fast Rust binary that plugs into Claude Code and quietly trims the fat from everything Claude reads — your files, your command output, your searches — so you burn fewer tokens and your context window lasts a lot longer.**

No config to learn. No clutter in the chat. Nothing the model has to think about. It just works.

## 🤔 Why should I care?

Claude reads **a lot**. Every file you open, every `git diff`, every `grep`, every test run — it all gets stuffed into the context window, and every token costs you money and eats into the space Claude has left to actually think.

The thing is, most of that text is noise. Doc comments Claude already understood. The 400 lines of a stack trace that repeat the same frame. The `node_modules` paths in your search results. snip strips the noise and keeps the signal — **automatically, on every tool call, before it ever reaches the model.**

> 💡 **The result:** typically **30–70% fewer tokens** on code reads, a context window that lasts way longer, and a smaller bill — with zero change to how you work.

---

## ✨ What makes snip different

Plenty of tools try to save tokens for Claude Code. Most stop at the Bash tool, use fragile regex to *guess* where your comments end (and quietly break Claude's edits), and brag about "savings" that ignore the re-reads they cause. snip was built to fix exactly those three things.

| | **snip** | Typical token optimizers |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Surfaces optimized** | Read · Bash · Grep · Glob | Bash only |
| **Code understanding** | tree-sitter **AST** (29 languages) | regex guesswork |
| **Keeps Claude's edits working** | ✅ byte-identical code | ❌ can corrupt edits |
| **Savings reported** | **NET** (saved − re-reads) | gross (inflated) |
| **Footprint in the model's context** | **zero** — no markdown, no MCP tools | varies |
| **When output is huge** | rewrites, then spills it **recoverably** | truncates / drops it |

In plain English: snip understands your code instead of pattern-matching it, covers every place tokens leak (not just the terminal), and is **honest** about what it saves — it counts the cost of any re-read against the gain, so the number you see is the number you actually keep.

## 🚀 Install

snip ships as a **Claude Code plugin** — install *and* updates both flow through it. No curl-pipe-bash, no package manager, no editing `settings.json`.

```text
/plugin marketplace add snip-ai/snip
/plugin install snip@snip
```

> The `/plugin` commands above are for the Claude Code **CLI**. In the **integrated** Claude Code (IDE extension / desktop app), add the marketplace and install snip from the **Manage plugins** panel instead.

On first run, the plugin grabs the prebuilt binary for your platform, verifies its checksum, and drops it in your OS data dir. Hooks call it by absolute path from there. That's it — you're optimizing.

**Supported:** macOS (arm64 / x64), Linux (x64), Windows (x64). On Windows the hooks run through Git Bash (which Claude Code already needs). If anything's missing, snip safely does nothing and you get your original output back.

---

## 🔄 Staying up to date

snip updates in two layers, and they refresh through different channels:

- **The binary** — where all the optimizing happens — **updates itself automatically.** On session start snip checks the latest GitHub release in the background and, if a newer build exists, fetches and checksum-verifies it so it's live next session. Nothing to run; `/snip update` forces an immediate check.
- **The plugin wiring** (hooks, the `/snip` command, manifest) refreshes when Claude Code re-pulls the marketplace. Claude Code does **not** auto-refresh third-party marketplaces by default, so to keep this hands-off, enable auto-update for the `snip` marketplace **once** — toggle it in the `/plugin` menu, or add `"autoUpdate": true` to the `snip` entry under `extraKnownMarketplaces` in your settings. Otherwise refresh on demand with `/plugin marketplace update snip` then `/plugin install snip@snip`.

In practice the binary — the part you actually feel — stays current on its own. The one-time marketplace opt-in only matters for releases that change the hooks or the `/snip` command itself; if the wiring ever lags, the manual refresh above pulls it forward.

---

## 🧠 How it works

snip hooks into Claude Code's **native tools** and rewrites their output in flight — so the model just receives a leaner version, with no idea snip was ever there.

- **📖 Read** — strips comments via tree-sitter across **29 languages**, with `soft` / `medium` / `high` modes. Code lines stay **byte-identical**, so Claude's follow-up Edits still land perfectly. (And if an Edit ever drifts, `snip resolve` maps it back to the real bytes.)
- **💻 Bash** — recognizes **60+ commands** out of the box and rewrites their output: `git`, the base shell toolkit (`ls`, `grep`, `find`, `docker`, `kubectl`…), and the major language toolchains (`cargo`, `npm`, `pytest`, `go test`, `gradle`, `dotnet`, `eslint`…). Don't recognize it? snip auto-compacts JSON and folds repetitive logs anyway.
- **🔎 Grep / Glob** — rewrites (not just truncates) results, grouping noisy path lists by directory so you see the shape, not the spam.
- **🛟 Never loses your data** — when output is genuinely huge, snip compacts it *first*, then spills the full version to a session file with a one-line breadcrumb. Recoverable, always.

Everything runs on a strict **sub-15ms budget** (most reads finish in 1–2ms), every hook **exits cleanly no matter what**, and snip **never writes to your source files**.

## 🎛️ Usage

snip works the moment it's installed — there's nothing to run. When you want to peek under the hood, it's one command, `/snip <sub>`:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/snip gain` | See your token savings (the honest **net** number) |
| `/snip status` | Version, master switch, and per-optimizer state |
| `/snip config …` | Get / set / list / reset settings |
| `/snip enable` · `/snip disable` | Flip the master switch |
| `/snip update` | Force a check for the latest release and fetch it if newer |
| `/snip shell-setup` | Add (or `remove`) the binary's `PATH` line |
| `/snip uninstall` | Remove snip's data, binary, and `PATH` line (remove the plugin separately) |

Prefer a terminal? snip puts its binary on your `PATH` on first install, so the
same subcommands — `snip status`, `snip gain`, `snip config list` — run straight
from a shell with **no model turn**. Undo the `PATH` line with `/snip shell-setup
remove`. Everything runs through git bash; install and updates still flow only
through the plugin.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Sane defaults, fully tunable. Settings layer cleanly: **built-in → your user config → an opt-in, trust-gated project layer** (`.snip/config.json`). Tweak a mode, toggle an optimizer, or add your own command rules — all as plain JSON, **no recompile**:

```text
/snip config set optimizers.read.mode high
```

The transform vocabulary is **closed and declarative** — no regex, no scripting, no remote-code-execution surface hiding in a config file. Safe by design.

## 🛠️ Building from source

You don't need this to use snip — but if you want to hack on it:

```bash
cargo build --release                        # optimized binary
cargo test                                   # full suite (unit + integration + e2e)
cargo fmt --check                            # formatting
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings    # lints (all / pedantic / nursery denied)
```
